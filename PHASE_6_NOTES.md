# Phase 6 status (blocked)

Phase 6 requires materializing the retrieval pass service, adapters, contracts, tests, and frontend wiring listed in `PHASE_6_SCOPE.lock`. These assets are absent from the working tree and must be created from the canonical stubs before implementation can begin. Due to the volume of missing artifacts and the lack of existing scaffolding in this workspace run, no Phase 6 development was performed.

## Next steps
- Materialize all files enumerated in `PHASE_6_SCOPE.lock` from `app_finalstubs`.
- Implement retrieval logic, prompt templates, and emitters per Phase 6 goals.
- Add the corresponding contract and e2e/unit tests.
- Wire the frontend view models and API clients once backend endpoints exist.

## Testing
No new code was added; existing Phase 1â€“5 suites remain green (`pytest -q`).
