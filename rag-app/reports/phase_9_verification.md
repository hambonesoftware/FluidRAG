# Phase 9 Verification Report

## Phase 9 Checklist
| Deliverable | Status | Notes |

| New storage tests (`backend/app/tests/unit/test_storage.py`) | ✅ | Cover JSON/JSONL persistence, invalid rows, streaming IO, and missing-file errors. |
| New vector tests (`backend/app/tests/unit/test_vectors.py`) | ✅ | Exercise BM25, FAISS, hybrid search, and online/offline Qdrant paths. |
| New pass route tests (`backend/app/tests/unit/test_pass_routes.py`) | ✅ | Validate pass manifest/list/get behaviors, error logging, and payload schema. |
| New route error mapping tests (`backend/app/tests/unit/test_route_error_mapping.py`) | ✅ | Assert upload/parser/chunk/header routes convert service errors to HTTP status codes. |
| New identifier tests (`backend/app/tests/unit/test_ids.py`) | ✅ | Confirm doc ID normalization and pass artifact naming. |
| New LLM client tests (`backend/app/tests/unit/test_llm_client.py`) | ✅ | Verify offline synthesis, deterministic embeddings, and online guard rails. |
| Pytest marker registration for Phase 9 | ✅ | `pyproject.toml` includes `phase9` marker ensuring selection parity with prior phases. |
| Documentation/reporting updates | ✅ | `CHANGELOG.md`, `README.md`, and `reports/phase_9_outcome.md` describe fixtures, suites, and workflows; this verification adds follow-up notes. |

## Traceability Matrix
| Plan Item | Implementation | Tests & Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Shared fixtures (`conftest.py`) | `backend/app/tests/conftest.py` | Consumed by unit suites (upload, parser, chunk, headers, passes, storage, vectors, pass routes, route error mapping) and e2e pipeline test. |
| Curated engineering document | `backend/app/tests/data/documents/engineering_overview.txt` | Materialized by `sample_pdf_path` fixture; referenced in upload/parser/chunk/header/pass/e2e tests. |
| Expected headers/passes JSON | `backend/app/tests/data/json/expected_sections.json` | Used by `expected_sections` fixture for header/pass/e2e assertions. |
| Upload normalization coverage | `backend/app/tests/unit/test_upload.py` | Asserts manifest stats, header presence, and idempotence. |
| Parser enrichment coverage | `backend/app/tests/unit/test_parser.py` | Validates language detection, reading order, OCR branch, and error handling. |
| Chunking & vector coverage | `backend/app/tests/unit/test_chunk.py`, `backend/app/tests/unit/test_vectors.py` | Ensures UF chunk artifacts, hybrid search behavior, FAISS persistence, Qdrant offline path. |
| Header join/rechunk coverage | `backend/app/tests/unit/test_headers.py` | Asserts header detection, section mapping, sequence repair, and benchmarking helpers. |
| Pass orchestration coverage | `backend/app/tests/unit/test_passes.py` | Exercises retrieval scoring, manifest writing, schema validation, and context window composer. |
| Pipeline orchestration coverage | `backend/app/tests/e2e/test_pipeline_e2e.py`, `backend/app/tests/unit/test_pass_routes.py` | End-to-end `/pipeline/run` flow plus pass manifest/list/get routes. |
| Storage adapter coverage | `backend/app/tests/unit/test_storage.py` | Validates JSON/JSONL IO, streaming paths, and error handling branches. |
| Route error mapping coverage | `backend/app/tests/unit/test_route_error_mapping.py` | Confirms threadpool invocations and HTTP status translation for upload/parser/chunk/header routes. |
| Identifier helpers | `backend/app/tests/unit/test_ids.py` | Ensures normalization and artifact naming invariants. |
| LLM adapters | `backend/app/tests/unit/test_llm_client.py` | Verifies offline/online chat behavior and deterministic embeddings. |
| Pytest marker | `pyproject.toml` | `phase9` marker registered to avoid deselection warnings. |
| Documentation & reporting | `CHANGELOG.md`, `README.md`, `reports/phase_9_outcome.md`, `reports/phase_9_verification.md` | Phase 9 scope, fixture workflow, and verification outcomes recorded. |

_No gaps observed: every Phase 9 plan item is implemented and exercised by deterministic tests. Final stubs omit explicit entries for new tests but runtime code matches plan specifications._

## Static Checks
- `ruff check backend/app --fix` (clean)【528741†L1-L2】
- `ruff format backend/app` (no changes required)【2f7859†L1-L2】
- `mypy backend/app --pretty --show-error-codes --strict` (clean)【d847ec†L1-L2】

## Test Summary
- `pytest -q --maxfail=1 --disable-warnings -W error` → 96 passed【ad0a29†L1-L3】
- `pytest --cov=backend/app --cov-report=term-missing -W error` → 96 passed, 91% line coverage across `backend/app`【d3687d†L1-L60】

## Cross-Phase Adjustments
- Re-exported route modules in `backend/app/routes/__init__.py` so strict mypy recognizes service helpers referenced by route error tests, without altering public router APIs.【F:backend/app/routes/__init__.py†L1-L22】
- Updated vector persistence test to use `math.isclose` and route error mapping test to compare against service functions, preserving behavior while satisfying strict typing expectations.【F:backend/app/tests/unit/test_vectors.py†L1-L47】【F:backend/app/tests/unit/test_route_error_mapping.py†L1-L194】

## Residual Issues
- Runtime warnings: None (tests executed with `-W error`).
- Type-checking errors: None (strict mypy clean).
- Lint/style violations: None (ruff clean).
