# Phase 11 Outcome

## ✅ Checklist
- Release checklist CLI validates README, changelog, backlog, and env templates for handover.
- Offline pipeline demo script exercises orchestrator run/status/results for demos.
- README reorganised with quickstart, environment setup, and troubleshooting guidance.
- Backlog report captures next-iteration opportunities.

## Test & Quality Summary
- `pytest -q --maxfail=1 --disable-warnings` — 103 passed (backend + frontend/demo suites).
- `pytest --cov=backend/app --cov-report=term-missing` — 91% coverage across `backend/app`.
- `mypy backend/app --pretty --show-error-codes` — success, 134 files checked.
- `ruff check backend/app tests --fix` — no remaining lint violations after auto-fix.
- `ruff format backend/app tests` — codebase formatted.

## Verification Run — 2025-10-04
- README audit confirmed quickstart, environment setup, and troubleshooting guidance remain aligned with Phase 11 scope.
- Release tooling (`scripts/release_checklist.py`, `scripts/offline_pipeline_demo.py`) present and callable for handover workflows.
- Changelog reflects Phase 11 deliverables with documentation of new scripts and README updates.
- Backlog and outcome reports (`reports/post_phase_backlog.md`, this file) available for next-iteration planning.
- `pytest` (full backend suite covering phases 1–11) — 107 passed on Python 3.12.10.

## Cross-Phase Adjustments
- `pytest.ini` now includes `rag-app/tests` so frontend/demo suites remain part of the default run.

## Migration Notes
- No database schema changes or migrations were required for Phase 11.

## Known Limitations
- None.
