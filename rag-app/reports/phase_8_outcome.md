# Phase 8 Outcome

## ✅ Checklist
- Updated frontend HTML, CSS, and JS (api client, models, view-models, and views) to deliver the MVVM dashboard with polling, offline handling, and artifact downloads.
- Added Node-backed pytest module `tests/phase_8/test_frontend_viewmodels.py` validating PipelineVM polling and ResultsView artifact behavior.
- Refreshed documentation (README, CHANGELOG) and recorded scope in `PHASE_8_SCOPE.lock`.

## Test Coverage & Scenarios
- `pytest -q --maxfail=1 --disable-warnings` (46 passed) covers backend phases 1–8 plus the new frontend harness.
- `pytest --cov=backend --cov-report=term-missing` reports 87% line coverage across backend modules (unchanged baseline) while exercising new polling loops via Node.
- Frontend-specific tests assert:
  - PipelineVM stops polling once audit status is `ok` and materializes pass results + artifact paths.
  - ResultsView triggers artifact downloads, emits offline/missing events, and avoids DOM writes when offline.

## Cross-Phase Changes
- Switched the frontend offline meta flag default to `false` so new users can interact with the live dashboard without editing HTML; offline mode remains configurable via the meta tag or environment flag.

## Migration Notes
- No database schema or data migrations required.

## Known Limitations
- None.
