# Phase 10 Outcome

## ✅ Checklist
- Observability middleware issues correlation IDs and structured timing logs for every request.
- Config expanded with OpenRouter retry/batch tuning, audit retention, and storage chunk helpers.
- Stage controllers (parser, chunk, headers, passes) emit audit duration metadata and span logs.
- OpenRouter client honours configurable retries/backoff/idle thresholds with span logging; storage/vector adapters respect batch settings.
- Unit coverage added for logging correlation context, audit records, config overrides, OpenRouter retries, and middleware headers.
- E2E orchestrator tests assert structured pipeline audit payloads and correlation propagation.
- README and CHANGELOG document new observability knobs and profiling workflow.

## Test & Quality Summary
- `pytest -q --maxfail=1 --disable-warnings` (103 tests) — ✅
- `pytest --cov=rag-app/backend/app --cov-report=term-missing` — 91% overall coverage. ✅
- `mypy rag-app/backend/app --pretty --show-error-codes` — ✅
- `ruff check rag-app/backend/app --fix` / `ruff format rag-app/backend/app` — ✅

## Cross-Phase Adjustments
- Logging helper now namespaces child loggers under `fluidrag.*` to guarantee handler alignment with the shared JSON formatter.
- Tests that assert logging side-effects patch module loggers to deterministic in-memory streams to avoid stderr contention introduced by the new middleware.

## Migration Notes
- No database schema changes; audit outputs remain filesystem-based alongside existing artifacts.

## Known Limitations
- Legacy mock packages (parser/header/upload internals) retain partial coverage; future phases should backfill tests if plan requires.
