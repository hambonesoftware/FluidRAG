# Phase 7 Outcome

## ✅ Checklist
- [x] Hardened `backend/app/routes/orchestrator.py` to expose audit metadata, validate manifests/results, and secure artifact streaming paths.  
- [x] Added asynchronous streaming import guards in `backend/app/adapters/storage.py` to keep chunked responses functioning.  
- [x] Authored `backend/app/tests/unit/test_orchestrator_routes.py` covering happy path, validation, error, and streaming scenarios.  
- [x] Documented the orchestrator endpoints in `README.md` and logged scope in `CHANGELOG.md`.  
- [x] Created `requirements-dev.txt` to install lint/type/coverage tooling for future phases.

## Test & Quality Summary
- Pytest (phases 1–7): `pytest -q --maxfail=1 --disable-warnings` → 46 passed.  
- Full suite with coverage: `pytest --cov=backend/app --cov-report=term-missing` → 46 passed, overall coverage 87%.  
- Lint/format: `ruff check rag-app`, `ruff format rag-app` (applied).  
- Type check baseline (`mypy rag-app`) reports existing errors in earlier modules (no new regressions introduced).

## Cross-Phase Notes
- No behavioural changes outside the orchestrator surface; existing services/tests remain untouched aside from formatting revert.

## Migration / Data Considerations
- No database schema changes or data migrations.

## Known Limitations
- None.
