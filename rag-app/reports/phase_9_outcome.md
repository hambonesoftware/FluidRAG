# Phase 9 Outcome

## ✅ Checklist
- Added curated backend fixtures (text-derived pseudo-PDF and JSON) under
  `backend/app/tests/data/` and shared pytest helpers in `backend/app/tests/conftest.py`.
- Refactored upload, parser, chunk, headers, passes, and orchestrator tests to execute against the curated fixture and capture
  richer invariants.
- Elevated the end-to-end pipeline test to run the real FastAPI stack, verifying status, results, and artifact streaming.
- Added focused suites for storage I/O, hybrid vector search, pass manifest routes, route-level error mapping,
  identifier helpers, and the offline LLM adapter to harden edge cases.
- Documented new workflows in README/CHANGELOG and recorded scope in `PHASE_9_SCOPE.lock`.

## Test Coverage & Scenarios
- `pytest -q --maxfail=1 --disable-warnings` (96 passed) spans phases 1–9 using curated fixtures for deterministic offline runs.
- `pytest --cov=backend/app --cov-report=term-missing` reports 91% line coverage across backend modules, exercising adapters,
  routes, and the full pipeline along with negative/error paths.
- Additional checks: `mypy backend/app --pretty --show-error-codes`, `ruff check backend/app --fix`, and `ruff format backend/app`.

## Cross-Phase Changes
- Centralised environment setup and fixture loading via `backend/app/tests/conftest.py`, reducing duplication in earlier tests.
- Expanded pytest marker registrations (phases 6–9) to remove warnings and align with the growing suite; introduced
  helper functions inside new tests to avoid async plugin dependencies while still exercising coroutine APIs.

## Migration Notes
- No database schema or data migrations were required; new assets live purely in the test fixture tree.

## Known Limitations
- None.
