1. Introduction
This document summarises the servo drive upgrade and telemetry expectations.

1.1 Mechanics
Torque requirement is 50 Nm at 200 RPM with redundant coupling.

1.2 Materials
All fasteners are grade 10.9 with corrosion resistant coating.

2. Controls and Safety
Controller monitors pressure, temperature, and vibration sensors for excursions.
- Install redundant watchdog timers.
- Validate firmware checksum before activation.
