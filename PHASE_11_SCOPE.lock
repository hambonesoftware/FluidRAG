- Refresh rag-app/README.md with quickstart, environment setup, troubleshooting guidance, and references to the handover scripts.
- Update rag-app/CHANGELOG.md with the Phase 11 release summary and final version tag.
- Create rag-app/reports/phase_11_outcome.md documenting checklist completion, quality gates, and migration status.
- Create rag-app/reports/post_phase_backlog.md capturing triaged nice-to-haves for the next iteration.
