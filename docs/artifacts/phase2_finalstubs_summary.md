# Phase 2 Finalstubs Summary — Upload & Parser Upgrade

## Inputs Reviewed
- `parser_upgrade_plan/overview.md`
- `parser_upgrade_plan/phase2_finalstubs.md`
- Existing planning materials in `app_plan/03_Upload_Parser.md` and `app_plan/07_Routes_Orchestrator.md`
- Phase 1 artifacts were not present in the repository; gaps were inferred from planning notes.

## Major Additions
1. **Uploader Surface** — Defined `POST /api/uploads` contract with strict validation (size, extension, MIME sniffing, checksum) and storage/indexing expectations in `app_plan/finalstubs_upload.json`.
2. **Upload Controller Handoff** — Captured ULID doc ID policy, queue submission contract, and observability propagation in `app_plan/finalstubs_upload_controller.json`.
3. **Parser Pipeline** — Detailed extractor hierarchy, normalization, UF chunking, EFHG scoring thresholds, sequence repair schemas, tuning bounds, artifact inventory, and result routes in `app_plan/finalstubs_parser.json`.
4. **Configuration Surface** — Documented TOML keys and tuned-config precedence in `app_plan/finalstubs_config.json` to generalize policies without document-specific hacks.
5. **Logging & Telemetry** — Set structured logging expectations, EFHG debug payloads, metrics, and traces in `app_plan/finalstubs_logging_telemetry.json`.
6. **Test Requirements** — Enumerated Phase 3 regression tests for validation, parser behavior (including OCR), and full API flow in `app_plan/finalstubs_tests.json`.
7. **Aggregator Update** — Published `app_plan/finalstubs_latest.json` referencing every Phase 2 module with shared route/config summaries for downstream tooling.
8. **Schemas & Docs** — Authored JSON Schemas for upload responses, headers tree, gaps report, and status payload plus this summary and the crosswalk artifact.

## Phase 1 Gap Coverage
- **Upload validation gaps** (size/MIME/double extension) addressed via explicit validation block.
- **Parser observability gaps** bridged by structured log + trace definitions.
- **Artifact schema ambiguity** resolved by delivering JSON Schemas and tying them to routes.
- **Test coverage gaps** mapped to concrete pytest targets with fixtures and assertions.

## Implementation Guidance for Phase 3
- Align FastAPI route implementations with the schemas referenced in the finalstubs.
- Ensure parser jobs persist artifacts exactly under `storage/parser/{doc_id}` with the enumerated filenames.
- Load configuration via `configs/app.toml`, overriding with tuned configs when present, and respect the stated precedence.
- Integrate metrics/tracing instrumentation early to maintain observability parity with the plan.
