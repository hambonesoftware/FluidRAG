# Phase 2 â€” Finalstubs Design

### Objectives
- Extend or adjust finalstubs in `app_plan/`.
- Ensure upload, controller, parser, config, routes, logging, and tests are fully defined.

### Deliverables
- New or updated `finalstubs_*.json` under `app_plan/`.
- Clear mapping from gaps to new finalstubs entries.
